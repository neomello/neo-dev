# Contributing to this project

Thank you for considering a contribution.

This project does not accept ad-hoc changes. It accepts **intentional contributions** aligned with the architecture, standards, and long-term continuity of the system.

Contributing here means preserving predictability, security, and recoverability.

---

## Code of Conduct

This project follows **NEØ development standards**.

That implies:

*  Respectful and objective communication
*  Technical discussions grounded in evidence
*  Zero tolerance for hostile or careless behavior

High-reliability systems require professional posture.

---

## Development Model

This repository uses a **main-first** workflow aligned with modern DevSecOps practices.

Principles:

*  `main` always represents a recoverable state
*  No direct commits to `main`
*  All changes enter via Pull Request

### Branching Strategy

*  `feature/short-description` for new functionality
*  `fix/short-description` for bug fixes
*  `experiment/name` for experiments and proofs of concept

Long-lived branches are discouraged.

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Clone your fork locally
3.  Add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/neomello/neo-template
```

---

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/short-description
# or
git checkout -b fix/short-description
```

---

### 3. Development Guidelines

Non-negotiable rules:

*  **Always** follow the standards defined in `standards/`
*  **Always** add tests when introducing new functionality
*  **Never** commit credentials, private keys, or secrets
*  **Always** assess security impact before committing

If something is not documented, assume it must not be changed.

---

### 4. Commits

Commits must be clear, small, and traceable.

Format:

```
type: concise description
```

Accepted types:

*  `feat:` new functionality
*  `fix:` bug fix
*  `docs:` documentation
*  `refactor:` refactoring without behavior change
*  `chore:` maintenance tasks

Examples:

*  `feat: add recovery script`
*  `fix: correct input validation`
*  `docs: clarify security guidelines`

---

### 5. Pull Requests

Before opening a PR:

1.  Ensure all tests pass
2.  Update relevant documentation
3.  Clearly explain **what changed** and **why**
4.  Reference related issues if applicable

PRs without context will not be merged.

---

## Technical Standards

### Formatting

*  Indentation follows `.editorconfig`
*  Python and Solidity use 4 spaces
*  Markdown requires a blank line after headers
*  No trailing whitespace
*  Always include a final newline

---

### Security

*  **Never** commit `.env`, `.key`, `.secret` files
*  **Never** expose private keys or credentials
*  **Always** use environment variables for sensitive configuration
*  **Always** review diffs with a security mindset

Security is not a final step. It is a prerequisite.

---

### Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and AI

*  Smart contracts must be backed up before modification
*  Private keys must never appear in code or versioned files
*  Large AI models should be treated as external artifacts
*  Deployment scripts must be reviewed carefully before execution

Mistakes here are incidents, not bugs.

---

## Project Structure

⚠️ **STRUCTURE PROTECTED BY NEØ ARCHITECTURE**

The project layout is intentional.

*  Review `.cursorrules`
*  Do not rename or move structural directories
*  Do not alter core files without architectural justification

Structural changes require consensus.

---

## Pre-Commit Checks

Run before committing:

```bash
git status
git diff
make check-security  # if available
```

Rushed commits create structural debt.

---

## Pull Request Checklist

*  [ ] Code follows established standards
*  [ ] Tests pass (when applicable)
*  [ ] Documentation updated
*  [ ] No credentials exposed
*  [ ] Commits are clear and scoped
*  [ ] Formatting is consistent

---

## Reporting Issues

Use GitHub Issues.

Good issues include:

*  Clear title
*  Reproducible steps when reporting bugs
*  Relevant environment context
*  Concise description

Vague issues slow the system down.
